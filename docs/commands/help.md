## Command and Callback Integration

The help command is registered in:

1. `commandOperations` in `src/bot/operations/command.operations.ts`:

   ```typescript
   [CommandsEnum.HELP]: handleHelpCommand,
   ```

2. `callbackOperations` in `src/bot/operations/callback.operations.ts`:
   ```typescript
   [CallbackEnum.HELP]: handleHelpCommand,
   ```

## Best Practices for Help Content

The help system follows these best practices:

1. **Organization**: Content is organized by categories (Basic Commands, Authentication, etc.)
2. **Formatting**: Uses Telegram HTML formatting with bold text and bullet points
3. **Completeness**: Covers all commands and major features
4. **Conciseness**: Provides enough detail to be useful without being overwhelming
5. **Resources**: Includes links to additional resources
6. **Accessibility**: Available to all users (not requiring authentication)
7. **Maintenance**: Kept up-to-date with all commands

- `src/constants/bot-commands.ts` - Defines all available commands
- `src/bot/operations/command.operations.ts` - Maps commands to handlers
- `src/bot/operations/callback.operations.ts` - Maps callbacks to handlers

## Extension Points

The help system can be extended in these ways:

1. **Localization**: Adding language support for help messages
2. **Command-specific Help**: Adding support for `/help command` to get detailed help for a specific command
3. **Interactive Help**: Adding interactive tutorials for complex features
4. **Contextual Help**: Providing help based on the user's current state
